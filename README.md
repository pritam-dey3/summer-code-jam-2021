<!-- The video goes here? -->
1. There are 6 options in start menu:
    - Start: To play normal level.
    - Infinite: To play infinite mode.
    - Tutorial: To know how to play.
    - Credits
    - Leaderboard
    - Quit
2. Use `Arrow Keys` to move.
3. At starting, a glimpse of whole maze will be shown. After it disappears, game will start.
4. Player has to reach `&` with minimum collision with wall and in minimum time.
5. Boxes:
    - It is the place to stop and think.
    - It will show part of the maze associated with the box.
    - Time slows down here.
6. Echo:
    - Press `e` to make a noise.
    - An echo will come from the direction in which player last moved.
    - Echo will get stronger as player is nearer to wall.
7. Persistence:
    - It acts as a score for a player.
    - Higher it is, better it is.
    - It will decrease with time.
    - It will decrease much more with each collision.
    - Since, time slows down in box, Persistence will decrease in lower rate inside the box.
    - It is placed in right top corner.
8. In left top corner, Number of collisions in each level is shown.
9. By pressing `q`, game will be paused. There will be an option to "Play again" or "Quit".
10. In normal level, a player can play 9 levels.
11. In infinite level, a player have to press `q` for quitting.
12. After completing level, a player, if wants, can put his/her name in `LeaderBoard` with his\her score.
